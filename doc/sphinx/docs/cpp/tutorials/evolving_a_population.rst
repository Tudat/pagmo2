Evolving a population
=====================

Solving an optimization problem using an optimization algorithm is, in pagmo,
described as *evolving* a population. In the scientific literature, an interesting
discussion has developed over the past decades on whether evolution is or not a form of
optimization. In pagmo we take the opposite standpoint and we regard optimization,
of all types, as a form of evolution. Regardless on whether you will be using an SQP,
an interior point optimizer or an evolutionary strategy solver, in pagmo you will
always have to call a method called ``evolve()`` to improve over your initial solutions,
i.e., your *population*.

After following the :ref:`install` you will be able to compile and run C++ pagmo
programs. The following example shows the use with no multithreading of an algoritmic evolution:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../docs/examples/nsga2.cpp
   :language: c++
   :linenos:

Place it into a ``nsga2.cpp`` text file and compile it (for example) with:

.. code-block:: bash

   g++ -O2 -DNDEBUG -std=c++11 nsga2.cpp
